git diff : compares staging area with present working directory.
git diff --staged: compares commit with staged area.
git commit -a -m "comment here" : by using this command we can skip the 
                 staging area for commit but the files that are untracked
                 will not be commited.
by using git commands we can assure time saving and direct staging of files
like:
git rm file_name : this will delete the file name entered
git mv old_name new_name : this will rename the file


to stop tracking files we cannot directy add them into gitignore
to stop tracking we must run a command
git rm --cached file_name : this will stop tracking of files
